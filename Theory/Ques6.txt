6. What is DDL Interpreter?

Ans:
A DDL Interpreter is a component of a database management system (DBMS) that 
processes Data Definition Language (DDL) commands. These commands are used to 
define or modify database structures, such as creating, altering, or deleting 
tables, indexes, and schemas. The interpreter parses the DDL statements and 
translates them into actions that update the database's metadata.
