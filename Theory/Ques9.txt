9. What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?

Ans : 
A SAVEPOINT in SQL is used to set a point within a transaction, allowing 
you to roll back to that point if needed, without rolling back the entire 
transaction. It provides a way to create intermediate restore points within a 
transaction.

Example to create a SAVEPOINT:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

->Some SQL operations
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
SAVEPOINT before_insert;  -- Create a savepoint

->Another SQL operation
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name) VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe');

->Rollback to the savepoint if needed
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_insert;

->Commit the transaction
COMMIT;


In this example:

A savepoint is created after the first insert.
If there's a need to revert to that point, the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT command 
can be used.
If everything is successful, the transaction is committed.
