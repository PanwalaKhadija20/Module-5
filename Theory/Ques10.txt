10. What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

Ans : 
A trigger in SQL is a special type of stored procedure that automatically 
executes or fires when certain events (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) occur on 
a specified table or view. Triggers help automate tasks such as data 
validation, auditing, or cascading updates.

How to create a trigger in SQL:
Here's an example of creating an AFTER INSERT trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, EmployeeID, Timestamp)
    VALUES ('INSERT', NEW.EmployeeID, NOW());
END;


Explanation:
AFTER INSERT: Specifies the trigger type (it fires after an insert operation).
ON Employees: Specifies the table the trigger is associated with.
FOR EACH ROW: Indicates that the trigger will execute once for each affected 
row.
BEGIN...END: Contains the SQL statements that are executed when the trigger is 
fired.
NEW.EmployeeID: Refers to the value of the inserted row's EmployeeID.
Triggers can also be defined for BEFORE events, and for UPDATE or DELETE 
operations, depending on the requirements.
